What's all this for
================

Instagram requires an access token to show the photos from your Instagram account on your website.  This helps Instagram keep their platform secure and prevent unauthorized use. You'll be taken to the Instagram site and you'll be asked to grant access to your photos.  You may be asked to log in.  After you grant acces you'll be taken back here, and you'll be able to copy your token into your theme settings.



### Why do I need to generate a token?
Tokens are a safe and secure way of limiting bandwidth on a per-account basis.  They allow Instagram to place reasonable limits on the amount of bandwidth that third party apps can use.

### Is this going to give you access to my Instagram account?
Tokens can be used to grant access to your account, but this token is a *read only* token that can only be used to get a feed of your most recent photos.

### Why should I trust Corknine? 
You don't have to, Corknine does not have access to your token or any of your private information.
